# UofT_ML_Datathon3 - ICU Mortality Prediction Datathon
 
## Context

The prediction of patient mortality within the first 24 hours of ICU admission is crucial for timely clinical decision-making and resource allocation. This project utilizes machine learning methods to predict patient mortality based on real-world ICU data, contributing valuable insights to support healthcare professionals and patient families during critical care situations.

## Dataset

We utilized the Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score (GOSSIS) dataset, which includes ICU patient data from diverse international settings, such as Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and over 200 hospitals in the United States. The data covers patient admissions over a full year, providing a robust basis for predictive modeling.

## Project Goals

- Explore the effectiveness of various Machine Learning models for predicting mortality within the first 24 hours of ICU admission.
- Determine key predictors influencing ICU mortality.
- Generate actionable insights for clinicians and caregivers to improve resource allocation and patient management.

## Project Structure

### Low-Fidelity Prototype
- Initial exploration and feature selection
- Preliminary data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Outline of machine learning methodologies planned

### High-Fidelity Prototype
- Implementation and optimization of selected machine learning models
